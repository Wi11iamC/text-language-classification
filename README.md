# text-language-classification

**Task for this Dataset:**

The task for this dataset will be a classification task. With this dataset we are attempting to create a machine learning model to accurately classify the language of texts from Amazon product reviews: English, German, French, and Spanish.

**Type of Machine Learning Problem:**

This problem is a supervised machine learning problem because the labels are provided in the dataset (language of data samples: 4 total). The labels are provided in the respective json file name (i.e. English reviews are provided in the json file with “en” in file name).

**Motivation:**

Increasingly, people are transitioning to online markets, like Amazon, as it becomes easier to place orders and purchase items over the internet. Amazon has been around since 1994 and has since then grown to millions of users around the world and has become a prominent global business. Amazon extended their marketplace to many regions where customers speak different languages. The language of a marketplace does not necessarily always match the language of a review placed by customers. In this project, we are going to try and create a machine learning model to classify the language of each text review: English, German, French, and Spanish. In essence, we are trying to create a model that can detect the language of texts. Such machine learning model can help break the language barrier between buyers and sellers. I find the concept of Languages and linguistics interesting because they are an integral part of humanity. Languages enable us to share ideas, thoughts and feelings. Every language has its unique rules and syntax, but they allow humans to communicate and express themselves in different ways. Understanding different languages is important for businesses to build connections and grow a network. This project gives us an opportunity to create a machine learning system by using methods learned in class to classify language of texts.
